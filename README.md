Glass-Notifications
===================
A Google Glass applications that will clone notifications from an Android 4.3+ device to Google Glass.  I have a working alpha version that I hope to release soon. (I'm undecided about opensourcing this yet)

* This app will uses my [IntentTunnel](https://github.com/TheMasterBaron/Glass-IntentTunnel/) project for communication from the phone to Glass.  IntentTunnel is a Intent router that handles bluetooth communications for multiple applications using a single bluetooth connection.

In Android 4.3, they introduced the option to capure notifications.  This is how Glass-Notifications will be able to forward your notificaitons to Glass
Goto Settings->Security->Notification Access and enable NotificationToGlass.

Here is a screen shot of Glass-Notifications capturing my notifications and allowing me to pick which ones I want.  By default, notificaitons that are dismissable are enabled and ones that are not are disabled.  You can enable/disable them using this tool.  Also, when capturing the notifications, the larger versions of the notificaiton are used to show more information on Glass.

Here is the notification telling me I have an auto awesome picture waiting for me.  This notification made a sound on my phone, so it also made a sound on Glass to let me know there is something waiting for me.  If I look up within 5 seconds, the notificaiton will be there for me to see.

The auto awesome notificaiton is dismisable on my phone.  So, I have the option to dismiss it from Glass.

I have installed an app called Notificaiton Weather from the play store.  This app puts a permenant weather forcast im my notifications.  This is not dismisable so it's just a livecard that gives me the weather. BONUS!
