A Google Glass applications that will clone notifications from an Android 4.3+ device to Google Glass.

Here is a screen shot of my notifications bar pulled down on my phone:

Here is a screen shot of Glass-Notifications capturing my notifications and allowing 
me to pick which ones I want.  By default, notificaitons that are dismissable are 
enabled and ones that are not are disabled.  You can enable/disable them using this tool.
Also, when capturing the notifications, the larger versions of the notificaiton are used to 
show more information on Glass.

In Android 4.3, they introduced the option to capure notifications.  
Goto Settings->Security->Notification Access and enable NotificationToGlass

Here is the notification telling me I have an auto awesome picture waiting for me.  
This notification made a sound on my phone, so it also made a sound on Glass to let 
me know there is something waiting for me.  If I look up within 5 seconds, the notificaiton 
will be there for me to see.

The auto awesome notificaiton is dismisable on my phone.  So, I have the option to dismiss it from Glass.

I have installed an app called Notificaiton Weather from the play store.  This app puts a permenant weather 
forcast im my notifications.  This is not dismisable so it's just a livecard that gives me the weather. BONUS!

This is just an example of a simpler notification.
